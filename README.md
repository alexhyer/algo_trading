# algo_trading
Backtest and apply trading strategies on BTC using python

Single entry:
Each trade has only a single entry level with a set offset from where the trade triggers

DCA entry:
Each trade has three entry levels, each a defined amount and percentage from where the trade triggers 

These algos define their risk by looking at their worst historical performance. This can be scaled to whatever level is desired via leverage and position sizing. No matter how you use this you bear all financial responsibility.
