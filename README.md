Multiple trading strategties backtested and applied in python

Alice:
Alice is a trend following strategy. When the price has high momentum in a directing it tries to trade in that direction.

Boris:
Boris is a range trading strategy. It creates upper and lower bands based on standard deviation and tries to trade reversals when the bands are exceeded.

Castille:
Castille trades reversals detected using delta divergences. Unlike alice and boris, castille requires more than just price action to trade.

With these algos you can run low or high risk depending on the leverage you choose. No matter how you use this you bear all financial responsibility.
